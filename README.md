# GeofencingAndNotification
This respository is a simple project for using Geofencing and Notification in swift.
- Geofencing, or region monitoring as itâ€™s known in Apple parlance, requires setting up a circle to monitor. This is defined as a CLCircularRegion, with a center coordinate and a radius (in meters).
